Part of the top half of the right column is the controls for choosing which category the user would like to choose. 
The graphs and table change depend on the chosen category.
In addition, information about the cost/expenses of the chosen category is shown just below, for a family of four and per person.
When comparision is enabled, both provinces'/regions' respective information will show side-by-side, for ease of comparison.

- Compare between regions/provinces

Part of the top half of the right column is the controls for the regions and province. 
Users can choose to display either region or province, with the first dropdown list for choosing which region/province to show cost of living information.
This is where users can also enable comparison, with the second dropdown list for choosing the compared region/province.

On the left column, the app shows a choropleth map of the Philippines, segmented into each region or province. It is shaded based on the cost of living per region/province.

- Histogram and Line Graph

In the middle column, the app shows a histogram and line graph. The histogram shows the distribution of median costs, depending on the chosen category and province/region. 
The line graph shows the median costs/expenses of the chosen category by family size, also depending on the province/region. 
When comparison is enabled, both provinces'/regions' respective graphs will be shown comparitavely, for ease of comparison.
